# Operators in Python

This example illustrates the various operators available in Python.

## Code

```python
# Arithmetic Operators
a = 10
b = 3
print("Addition:", a + b)
print("Subtraction:", a - b)
print("Multiplication:", a * b)
print("Division:", a / b)
print("Modulus:", a % b)

# Comparison Operators
x = 5
y = 3
print("Equal:", x == y)
print("Not Equal:", x != y)
print("Greater Than:", x > y)
print("Less Than:", x < y)

# Logical Operators
p = True
q = False
print("AND:", p and q)
print("OR:", p or q)
print("NOT:", not p)
```

## Explanation

1. **Arithmetic Operators**: Used for mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
2. **Comparison Operators**: Used to compare values, resulting in a boolean outcome.
3. **Logical Operators**: Used to combine conditional statements.

## Expected Output

When you run this code, you should see the output of the various operations.

## Points to Consider

- Operators are fundamental in Python for performing various operations.
- Understanding the different types of operators is crucial for writing effective code.
