# Getting User Input in Python

This example shows how to get input from the user in Python.

## Code

```python
# Getting user input
user_input = input("Please enter something: ")
print("You entered:", user_input)
```

## Explanation

1. The `input()` function is used to get user input.
2. The string passed to `input()` is displayed as a prompt to the user.
3. The user's input is stored in the `user_input` variable.

## Expected Output

When you run this code, it will prompt you to enter something, and then it will print out what you entered.

## Points to Consider

- The `input()` function always returns a string.
- You can convert the input to other data types if necessary.
