# Using Inputs, Variables, and Strings in Python

This example demonstrates how to use user input, variables, and strings together in Python.

## Code

```python
# Getting user input and storing it in a variable
name = input("What is your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")

# Using variables and strings
greeting = "Hello, " + name + "! You are " + age + " years old."
print(greeting)
```

## Explanation

1. The `input()` function is used to get user input and store it in variables.
2. Variables are used to hold the user's input.
3. Strings are concatenated using the `+` operator.

## Expected Output

When you run this code, it will ask for your name and age, and then print out a greeting message with the information you provided.

## Points to Consider

- User input can be used to make your programs more interactive.
- Variables help store and manipulate data.
- String concatenation is a useful technique for combining text.
