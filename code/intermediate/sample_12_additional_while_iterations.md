# Additional While Loop Examples in Python

This example provides more illustrations of using while loops in Python.

## Code

```python
# Using a while loop to iterate over a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
i = 0
while i < len(fruits):
    print(fruits[i])
    i += 1
```

## Explanation

1. A while loop can be used to iterate over the elements of a list.
2. The loop variable `i` is used as an index to access the elements of the list.
3. The loop continues until `i` is no longer less than the length of the list.

## Expected Output

When you run this code, it will print the elements of the `fruits` list.

## Points to Consider

- While loops can be used for iterating over sequences like lists.
- Be mindful of the index variable and the condition to avoid errors.
