# For Loops in Python

This example demonstrates how to use a for loop in Python.

## Code

```python
# Using a for loop to iterate over a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

## Explanation

1. A for loop is used to iterate over the elements of a sequence (like a list or string).
2. The loop variable `fruit` takes on the value of each element in the `fruits` list in turn.
3. The code inside the loop is executed for each element.

## Expected Output

When you run this code, it will print the elements of the `fruits` list.

## Points to Consider

- For loops are a concise way to iterate over sequences.
- They are often more readable than while loops for this purpose.
