# While Loops in Python

This example demonstrates how to use a while loop in Python.

## Code

```python
# Using a while loop
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

## Explanation

1. A while loop is used to execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.
2. The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 and incremented by 1 in each iteration.
3. The loop continues until `i` is no longer less than 5.

## Expected Output

When you run this code, it will print the numbers 0 through 4.

## Points to Consider

- While loops are useful for repeating a task when you don't know in advance how many times it needs to be repeated.
- Make sure to update the loop variable to avoid an infinite loop.
