# Functions in Python

This example demonstrates how to define and use functions in Python.

## Code

```python
# Defining a simple function
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

# Calling the function
greet("Alice")
```

## Explanation

1. A function is defined using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parameters in parentheses.
2. The function `greet` takes a `name` parameter and prints a greeting message.
3. The function is called by using its name followed by the argument in parentheses.

## Expected Output

When you run this code, it will print "Hello, Alice!".

## Points to Consider

- Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.
- They help organize code and reduce repetition.
