# Solution Approximation Algorithm in Python

This example illustrates a solution approximation algorithm in Python.

## Code

```python
# Implementing a solution approximation algorithm
def approximate_solution(n):
    # Example approximation logic
    return n * 0.9

# Example usage
n = 100
approximation = approximate_solution(n)
print(f"Approximate solution: {approximation}")
```

## Explanation

1. A solution approximation algorithm provides an approximate solution to a problem.
2. The `approximate_solution` function takes a value `n` and returns an approximation.

## Expected Output

When you run this code, it will print the approximate solution.

## Points to Consider

- Approximation algorithms are useful when exact solutions are computationally expensive.
- They provide a trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.
