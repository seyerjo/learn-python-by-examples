# Algorithm: Binary Search for Solution Finding

This example demonstrates the **binary search** algorithm, a highly efficient method for finding a solution within a continuous, ordered range. This represents a major improvement over linear methods like exhaustive enumeration (`sample_19`) and solution approximation (`sample_20`).

## Concept: Divide and Conquer

Binary search is a "divide and conquer" algorithm. Instead of checking every possible value one by one, it works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.

1.  **Define a Search Space**: Start with a range where the solution must lie, defined by a `low` and a `high` boundary.
2.  **Make a Guess**: The first guess is the exact **midpoint** of the search space.
3.  **Eliminate Half**:
    -   If the guess is too low, you know the true answer must be in the upper half of the range. You can completely discard the lower half by moving the `low` boundary up to your guess.
    -   If the guess is too high, you know the answer must be in the lower half. Discard the upper half by moving the `high` boundary down to your guess.
4.  **Repeat**: Make a new guess at the midpoint of the _new, smaller_ search space. Repeat this process, halving the search space with each iteration, until the guess is "close enough" to the target.

This approach converges on a solution exponentially faster than linear methods.

## Code

The following code implements the binary search algorithm to find the approximate square root of a user-provided number.

```python

## Explanation

1.  **`main()` function**: Handles user interaction to get a valid non-negative integer.
2.  **`find_root_by_binary_search(target)` function**:
    -   It establishes the initial search space between `low = 0.0` and `high = target`.
    -   The first `guess` is the midpoint of this large range.
    -   The `while` loop continues as long as the guess is not precise enough (the error is larger than `epsilon`).
    -   Inside the loop, the `if/else` block is the core of the algorithm. It decides whether to discard the lower or upper half of the current search space by updating either the `low` or `high` boundary.
    -   A new `guess` is calculated at the midpoint of the newly reduced space.
    -   The `iterations` counter is included to highlight the algorithm's efficiency.

## Expected Output

Notice how few iterations are needed compared to the previous algorithms, especially for a large number.

```
--- Binary Search: Square Root Finder ---
Enter a non-negative integer: 123456

Algorithm finished after 21 iterations.
The approximate square root of 123456 is 351.3631

```

## Points to Consider

-   **Efficiency**: For a search space of size N, binary search takes approximately logâ‚‚(N) steps. This is a massive improvement over linear approaches, which take up to N steps.
-   **Prerequisites**: Binary search requires the solution space to be **ordered** and **monotonic**, meaning the values consistently increase or decrease. This is true for the square root problem.
-   **Generalization**: This powerful concept is not just for finding numbers. It's the foundation for searching in sorted arrays, dictionaries, and many other data structures.
