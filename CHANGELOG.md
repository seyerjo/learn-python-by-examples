# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.4]

### Added

- New intermediate example `sample_18_exception_handling.py` and its documentation (`sample_18_exception_handling.md`) demonstrating robust input validation using `try-except` blocks.

### Changed

- Renumbered advanced examples in `code/advanced/` from `sample_18` to `sample_22` to `sample_19` to `sample_23` respectively, to accommodate new `intermediate` examples and maintain sequential order.
- Added type hints to variables in all advanced examples (`sample_19` through `sample_23`) to ensure full compliance with code style guidelines.

## [1.0.3]

### Added

- New advanced example `sample_22_robust_input_validation.py` to teach robust user input handling.

- Cross-reference comments in advanced examples (`19` to `22`) pointing to the new Type Hinting explanation.

### Changed

- Improved advanced examples (`19`, `20`, `21`) by adding robust input validation and Type Hinting.
- Improved intermediate example `sample_16_recursive_functions.py` to correctly handle the `n=0` edge case for factorials.
