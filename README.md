## 👋 Welcome!

Welcome to the "Learn Python by Examples" repository! This project is designed to be a practical and accessible resource for anyone looking to learn or improve their Python skills. Here you will find a carefully curated collection of code examples, from the most basic concepts to more advanced topics, all with detailed comments to guide you through your learning journey.

We invite you to explore, experiment, and, of course, contribute. _Happy coding!_

## 🔍 Overview

This project is structured into three main difficulty levels: _basic_, _intermediate_, and _advanced_. Each example is self-contained and includes detailed documentation to facilitate understanding. The following diagram illustrates the main topics covered within the project.

## ✨ Main Features

- **📈 Pedagogical Progression**: Examples range from basic to advanced levels.

- **📦 Self-contained**: Each example is independent and does not require external dependencies.

- **💡 Detailed Comments**: Comments explain the code to facilitate understanding.

For a detailed breakdown of features and requirements, see the [Requirements](docs/02_requirements.md) and [Features](docs/03_features.md) documents.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Open the example files in your preferred code editor.

3. Study the code and comments.

4. Experiment with the examples to see how changes affect the program's behavior.
