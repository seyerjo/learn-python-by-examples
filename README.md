## üëã Welcome!

Welcome to the "Learn Python by Examples" repository! This project is designed to be a practical and accessible resource for anyone looking to learn or improve their Python skills. Here you will find a carefully curated collection of code examples, from the most basic concepts to more advanced topics, all with detailed comments to guide you through your learning journey.

We invite you to explore, experiment, and, of course, contribute. _Happy coding!_

## üîç Overview

This project is structured into three main difficulty levels: _basic_, _intermediate_, and _advanced_. Each example is self-contained and includes detailed documentation to facilitate understanding. The following diagram illustrates the main topics covered within the project.

For a more detailed overview, see the [Project Overview](docs/01_project_overview.md).

## ‚ú® Main Features

-   **üìà Pedagogical Progression**: Examples range from basic to advanced levels.

-   **üì¶ Self-contained**: Each example is independent and does not require external dependencies.

-   **üí° Detailed Comments**: Comments explain the code to facilitate understanding.

For a detailed breakdown of features and requirements, see the [Requirements](docs/02_requirements.md) and [Features](docs/03_features.md) documents.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Who is this project for?

While this repository is designed to be accessible, it is assumed that the user has a basic understanding of programming concepts from any language. To get the most out of these examples, it is recommended to be familiar with:

-   What variables and constants are.
-   Basic data types (integers, strings, booleans).
-   Common operators (arithmetic, comparison).
-   Basic use of a code editor or IDE (like Visual Studio Code).
-   Basic command line/console navigation.

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Open the example files in your preferred code editor.

3. Study the code and comments.

4. Experiment with the examples to see how changes affect the program's behavior.

For detailed instructions on setup, installation, and usage, refer to the [Setup and Installation Guide](docs/07_setup_and_installation.md) and the [Usage Guide](docs/08_usage_guide.md).
