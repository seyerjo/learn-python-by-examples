# Features

1.  **FEAT-01:** Collection of Python Code Examples

    - **Description:** A comprehensive collection of Python code examples covering various concepts and difficulty levels.
    - **Associated Requirements:** FR-01, FR-02
    - **Detailed Operation:** Users can browse through the examples, which are organized by difficulty and topic.
    - **Edge Cases:**
      - Examples with unexpected input types (e.g., string instead of int).
      - Handling empty or null input values in code samples.
      - Processing extremely large or small numeric values.
      - Examples that require external resources (e.g., files, network) and those resources are missing or inaccessible.
    - **Validation Rules:**
      - All code examples must be syntactically correct and executable.
      - Examples must include input validation where appropriate.
      - Each example should handle and document edge cases explicitly.
    - **Error Handling:**
      - If an example fails due to invalid input, a clear error message is provided in the output or comments.
      - For examples involving external services (e.g., API calls), the code should handle connection errors and timeouts gracefully, showing how to catch exceptions and log or display user-friendly messages.
      - If permissions are insufficient (e.g., file write access), the example must demonstrate catching the exception and reporting the issue.
      - All error scenarios are documented with sample outputs or comments explaining the expected behavior.

2.  **FEAT-02:** Documentation for Examples

    - **Description:** Clear and concise documentation for each code example, explaining its purpose and usage.
    - **Associated Requirements:** FR-03, FR-04, FR-06
    - **Detailed Operation:** Documentation is provided alongside each example, explaining the code and its expected output.
    - **Edge Cases:**
      - Documentation must address cases where code behavior changes due to input variations.
      - Updates are required if code changes or new edge cases are discovered.
    - **Validation Rules:**
      - Documentation must be accurate, up-to-date, and reflect all known edge cases and error handling strategies.
    - **Error Handling:**
      - If documentation is found to be incorrect or misleading, it must be corrected immediately.
      - Examples of documentation errors (e.g., outdated parameter descriptions) are tracked and resolved.

3.  **FEAT-03:** Repository Structure

    - **Description:** An organized repository structure that is easy to navigate.
    - **Associated Requirements:** FR-02, FR-05
    - **Detailed Operation:** The repository is structured with clear directories and file naming conventions.
    - **Edge Cases:**
      - Managing a large number of examples without losing clarity.
      - Handling contributions that do not follow the established structure.
      - Ensuring cross-platform compatibility for file paths.
    - **Validation Rules:**
      - All new files and directories must adhere to naming conventions and placement rules.
    - **Error Handling:**
      - If a contribution breaks the structure, maintainers must provide feedback and request corrections.
      - Automated checks may reject PRs that do not comply with the structure.

4.  **FEAT-04:** Robust Error Handling

    - **Description:** Implementation of error handling mechanisms to prevent program crashes from unexpected user input or other runtime issues.
    - **Associated Requirements:** NFR-03
    - **Detailed Operation:** The project introduces the `try-except` block to gracefully handle exceptions like `ValueError` (e.g., when a user enters text instead of a number) and `ZeroDivisionError`. This is demonstrated in dedicated examples.
    - **Edge Cases:**
      - User provides non-numeric input when a number is expected.
      - An operation attempts to divide by zero.
    - **Validation Rules:**
      - Input-dependent examples now include validation to ensure robustness.
    - **Error Handling:**
      - The system catches specific exceptions and provides clear, user-friendly feedback instead of crashing.
