# Project Tech Stack: Learn Python by Examples

This document details the technology stack chosen for the "Learn Python by Examples" project and justifies the selection of each main technology in the context of the project's goals.

## Main Technologies

The project relies on a set of well-established technologies suitable for an educational project focused on code and documentation.

### Python

-   **Reason for choice:** Python is the core programming language of the project, as the main goal is to teach and practice Python. Its clear and readable syntax, versatility, and wide adoption make it an excellent choice for beginners. Python's vast standard library allows addressing a wide variety of examples without the need for complex external dependencies.

-   **Interaction with other components:** Python is the main content of the `.py` files residing within the folder structure managed by Git/GitHub. The Markdown documentation (`.md`) explains the Python code.

### Markdown

-   **Reason for choice:** Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-learn markup language, ideal for writing clear and readable documentation. It is widely used on platforms like GitHub, making it easy to view and edit directly in the repository. It allows structuring text, including basic formatting, links, and code blocks simply.

-   **Interaction with other components:** Markdown files (`.md`) are stored alongside the corresponding Python files in the repository structure (Git/GitHub) and are used to explain the Python code.

### Git

-   **Reason for choice:** Git is the industry-standard version control system. It is essential for managing source code and documentation in an organized manner, allowing tracking changes, collaboration, and managing different versions of the project. GitHub provides a collaborative platform for hosting, reviewing, and sharing the repository.

-   **Interaction with other components:** Git is used to version all project files (Python code, Markdown documentation, configuration files, etc.) and manage the history of changes. GitHub enables collaboration, issue tracking, and visibility for contributors.

### Recommended Editors

-   **Reason for choice:** Editors such as Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or any Markdown-compatible editor are recommended for their support of Python syntax highlighting, Markdown preview, and Git integration, which streamline the development and documentation process.

-   **Interaction with other components:** These editors facilitate editing Python and Markdown files, running code, and managing version control operations seamlessly.

## Other Relevant Technologies

-   **Mermaid:** Used for generating diagrams within Markdown documentation, improving clarity and visual understanding of project structure and workflows.
-   **Prettier/Black (optional):** Formatting tools for Markdown and Python code, respectively, to ensure code and documentation consistency.

## Considered and Discarded Technologies

-   **Jupyter Notebooks:** Considered for interactive Python examples, but discarded to maintain a simple file-based structure and avoid additional dependencies for beginners.
-   **Heavyweight frameworks (e.g., Django, Flask):** Not included, as the project's focus is on core Python examples rather than web development.
-   **Proprietary documentation tools:** Discarded in favor of Markdown for its simplicity, portability, and compatibility with GitHub.

### GitHub

-   **Reason for choice:** GitHub is the largest and most popular Git repository hosting platform. It provides a web interface for viewing code and documentation, managing issues, reviewing contributions (pull requests), and facilitates collaboration on open-source projects. As the platform where the repository will be hosted, it is the central access point for users and collaborators.

-   **Interaction with other components:** GitHub hosts the Git repository containing all project files (Python, Markdown, etc.). It provides the tools to interact with the repository (clone, pull, push, etc.) and to manage the project collaboratively.

## Excluded Technologies (Initially)

Initially, the project focuses on the base Python language and its standard library. There are no plans to use web frameworks (like Flask or Django), graphical interface frameworks (like Tkinter or PyQt), or complex external APIs.

-   **Reason for exclusion:** The main goal is for beginners to focus on the fundamentals of Python. Introducing complex frameworks or APIs from the start could add an unnecessary learning curve and divert attention from the language itself. These topics could be considered for Advanced level examples or in future project expansions.
