- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.

- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.

- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive criticism.

- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community.

- Referring to people by their preferred pronouns and names.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind.

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.

- Public or private harassment.

- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.

- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
