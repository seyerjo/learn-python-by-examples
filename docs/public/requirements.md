# Project Requirements: Learn Python by Examples

This document describes the initial requirements, both functional and non-functional, for the project "Learn Python by Examples". These requirements are based on the vision, objectives, and general description of the project.

## Functional Requirements (FR)

Functional requirements describe the functions that the project must perform.

- **FR-01:** The project must contain a collection of code examples written in Python.

- **FR-02:** The code examples must be organized and classified according to their level of difficulty (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced).

- **FR-03:** Each code example must be accompanied by its corresponding explanatory documentation.

- **FR-04:** The documentation must explain the purpose of the code, how it works, and how to execute it.

- **FR-05:** Users must be able to easily access and view the source code of each example.

- **FR-06:** Users must be able to easily access and view the documentation associated with each example.

- **FR-07:** The project must support the addition of new code examples and their documentation.

- **FR-08:** The project must support the updating and improvement of existing code examples and their documentation.

## Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

Non-functional requirements describe how the project should function (quality, performance, usability, etc.).

- **NFR-01:** The repository structure must be intuitive and easy to navigate for users.

- **NFR-02:** The documentation must be clear, concise, and easy to understand for beginners.

- **NFR-03:** All provided code examples must be functional and free of basic syntax or logic errors (for the purpose of the example).

- **NFR-04:** The project must be hosted in a public repository on GitHub to facilitate access and collaboration.

- **NFR-05:** The project must be open to community contributions, following a defined process.

- **NFR-06:** The steps to set up the necessary environment and run the examples locally must be simple and well-documented.

- **NFR-07:** The difficulty classification of the examples must be consistent and useful to guide the user's learning.
