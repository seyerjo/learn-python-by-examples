## 3. Example-Specific Documentation ðŸ“„

In addition to the general project documentation listed above, it is crucial to note that **every code example has its own dedicated documentation file**.

- **Location:** These documentation files (`.md`) are located in the same directory as their corresponding Python script (`.py`) within the `code/` subfolders (`basic/`, `intermediate/`, `advanced/`).
- **Purpose:** Each `sample_xx_description.md` file provides a detailed explanation of the code in `sample_xx_description.py`, including the concepts it illustrates, a step-by-step breakdown, and the expected output.

This structure ensures that you have all the necessary context right where you need it when exploring a specific example.
