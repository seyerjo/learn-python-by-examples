# Setup and Installation Guide: Learn Python by Examples

This document describes the steps required to set up your environment and start using the code examples from the "Learn Python by Examples" project.

Since this project is a collection of Python scripts and documentation, it does not require a complex installation process. The main steps involve ensuring you have Python and Git installed, and then cloning the repository.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

1.  **Python:** You will need to have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from the official Python website: <https://www.python.org/downloads/>

    - To check if Python is installed and which version you have, open a terminal or command prompt and run:

      ```bash
      python --version
      # or
      python3 --version
      ```

2.  **Git:** You will need Git to clone the project repository. You can download it from the official Git website: <https://git-scm.com/downloads>

    - To check if Git is installed, open a terminal or command prompt and run:

      ```bash
      git --version
      ```

## Environment Setup and Usage

Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project and start exploring the examples:

1.  **Clone the Repository:** Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the repository from GitHub:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/seyerjo/learn-python-by-examples.git](https://github.com/seyerjo/learn-python-by-examples.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:** Once cloned, navigate into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd learn-python-by-examples
    ```

3.  **Explore Examples:** Inside the main directory, you will find folders organized by difficulty level (`basic`, `intermediate`, `advanced`). Navigate into the folder for the level you are interested in:

    ```bash
    cd basic
    # or
    cd intermediate
    # or
    cd advanced
    ```

4.  **Run Examples:** Inside each level folder, you will find the example files (`sample_0x_description.py`) and their associated documentation (`sample_0x_description.md`). To run a Python example, use the Python interpreter:

    ```bash
    python sample_01_hello_world.py
    # or
    python3 sample_01_hello_world.py
    ```

    _(Note: The `.py` filename will vary depending on the example)._

5.  **Read the Documentation:** Open the corresponding `.md` file in your favorite text editor or Markdown viewer to understand the code and its purpose before or after running it.

## End User Installation

This project is primarily designed as an educational resource and not as an application requiring traditional "installation" for the end user. The method of use is simply to clone the repository and run the Python scripts directly.
