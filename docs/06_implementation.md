# Project Implementation Details: Learn Python by Examples

This document describes the development approach, coding standards, initial time estimates, and technical guidelines for the implementation of the "Learn Python by Examples" project.

## Development Approach

Given that this is an open-source project focused on collecting and organizing examples, the development approach will be iterative and collaborative.

-   **Methodology:** A lightweight and flexible methodology, similar to Kanban, will be followed, where tasks (creating new examples, improving existing ones, documentation, fixes) will be managed through issues on GitHub. Formal sprints or complex ceremonies are not required.

-   **Branching Strategy:** A simple branching strategy based on GitHub Flow will be used. Contributions will be made through pull requests (PRs) to the main branch (`main`). Each new feature or fix will be developed in a separate branch before being merged.

## Coding Standards

To maintain code consistency and readability throughout the project, specific coding standards will be followed.

-   **Key Principles:**

    -   **PEP 8:** Python code must adhere to the PEP 8 style guidelines, the de facto standard for Python code.

    -   **Clarity and Readability:** The code should be easy to read and understand, especially considering that the target audience is beginners. Clarity will be prioritized over excessive conciseness.

    -   **Comments:** Explanatory comments will be included where necessary, especially in parts of the code that might be less intuitive for beginners.

    -   **Naming Conventions:** Recommended PEP 8 naming conventions will be followed (snake_case for functions and variables, PascalCase for classes, etc.).

-   **Tools:** The project currently uses `autopep8` for linting and `Prettier` for formatting, as configured in the repository. These tools help maintain code consistency and PEP 8 compliance.

-   **Reference:** For complete details, refer to the `code_style_guide.md` document.

## Time Estimates

Time estimates for completing the initial collection of 100 examples and all documentation are **TBD (To Be Determined)**. Progress will depend on the availability of maintainers and community contributions.

## Technical Guidelines and Best Practices

When implementing new examples or modifying existing ones, the following guidelines should be followed:

-   **Simplicity:** Examples should be as simple as possible to illustrate the specific concept they address. Avoid unnecessary complexity.

-   **Modularity (when applicable):** For longer or more complex examples, consider breaking down the code into functions to improve organization.

-   **Minimal Dependencies:** Limit the use of external libraries. If a dependency is necessary, it must be clearly mentioned in the example's documentation.

-   **Testing:** Each example script is verified to run without errors. The project includes basic pytest configurations for more complex examples, with plans to expand test coverage.

-   **Security:** Although this project does not handle sensitive data or complex network interactions, it is a good practice to be aware of basic security principles when writing code (e.g., avoiding execution of arbitrary code from user input if interactive examples are added in the future).

-   **Performance:** For the initial examples, performance is not the primary concern. However, for Advanced level examples involving large datasets or algorithms, performance considerations may be discussed in the documentation.
